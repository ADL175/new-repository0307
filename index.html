          <p> I grew up in the Redmond area, where I went to school at Benjamin Rush Elementary. We lived very close to the school and we walked to school everyday. My parents still own the same house.

          <h2 id="first">Teenage Years</h2>
          <p> I later went to Rose Hill Jr. High and later Lake Washington High School. While attending school, I played football, wrestling, and rugby.
            <comment> <em>My favorite was wrestling because it was a test of one's skill and resolve against another's. <br/>Rugby was my favorite team sport, because it was very dynamic and every player had a significant roll in advancing the ball.</em></comment>

          <h2 id="first">Adulthood</h2>
          <p> After finishing high school, I did odd jobs here and there. Later, I signed up and joined the Army in 2004.
            I served four years in Savannah, GA. I met my beautiful wife, Jennifer, in Savannah.

            After my time in the Army, I came back to Washington with Jennifer. I was employed in social work for
            several years. During this time, we had two amazing girls, Avery 4-years-old, and Zoe 1-year-old. I finished my four year degree
            and decided I wanted to learn a new skill, software development. I quit my job and started at school at Code Fellows!
