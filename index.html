          <h2 id="origin">Origin Story</h2>
          <p> I was born in Seattle, Washington. I am the first American born person in my family and I am the oldest of three boys. I grew up in the Redmond area, where I went to school at Benjamin Rush Elementary. We lived very close to the school and we walked to school everyday. My parents still own the same house.

        <section> <h2 id="present">Present</h2> <p> After my time in the Army, I
        came back to Washington with Jennifer. I was employed in social work for
        several years. During this time, we had two amazing girls, Avery
        4-years-old, and Zoe 1-year-old. I finished my four year degree and
        decided I wanted to learn a new skill, software development. I quit my
        job and started at school at Code Fellows! <br /> </p> </section> <div>
